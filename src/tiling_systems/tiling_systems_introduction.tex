\section{Recognizable Picture Languages}
In this section we present two approaches leading to the same class of languages. As many
approaches lead to this class of languages, it is called the
\emph{family of recognizable picture languages}, abbreviated as REC. At first we examine a system
that uses sets of tiles, to determine whether a picture belongs to a language or not. This approach
is required to define the deterministic recognizable picture languages in Section~\ref{diag_drec}.
Furthermore, we describe the domino systems which are necessary to define the deterministic process
in Section~\ref{deterministicprocess}. Keep in mind that the domino system is also a possible
approach to describe REC.
