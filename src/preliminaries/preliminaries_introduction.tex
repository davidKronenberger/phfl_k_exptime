\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{ch:preliminaries}
This chapter introduces all necessary definitions to prove that PHFL$^k =$~\exptime{$k$} and
PHFL$^{k+1}_{tail} =$~\expspace{$k$}. The notions are mainly from~\cite{immerman1999descriptive},
~\cite{papadimitriou1994complexity},~\cite{otto1999bisimulation},~\cite{freireMartins2011descriptive}
and~\cite{lange2014capturing}.

We assume that the reader is already familiar with basic notions of first order logic and 
computational complexity. In the first section we define a special kind of graph called labelled transition systems and 
define some operations on it. Additionally, we define queries and special forms of queries. 
In the next section we give some information on fixpoints that are used in the section that follows. 
There the logic PHFL is defined. In Section~\ref{sec:descriptiveComplexity} we present the 
descriptive complexity and the complexity classes \exptime{$k$} and \expspace{$k$}. In the last section we define the higher-order logic and combinations with LFP and PFP.
