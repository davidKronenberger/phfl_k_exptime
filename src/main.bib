We introduce the notion of deterministic tiling system that generalizes deterministic automata for strings. The corresponding family of languages matches all the requirements of a robust deterministic class. Furthermore we show that, differently from the one-dimensional case, there exist many classes between deterministic and non-deterministic families that we separate by means of examples and decidability properties.},

@article{inoue1977properties,
    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose a new type acceptor called the �two-dimensional on-line tessellation acceptor� (denoted by �2-ota�) and to examine several properties of the 2-ota. The 2-ota might be considered as a real-time mode of rectangular array bounded cellular space, introduced by Smith and Beyer. First, several fundamental properties (e.g., closure properties) of the 2-ota are examined. Then, the accepting power of the 2-ota is compared with that of the two-dimensional finite automaton, introduced by Blum and Hewitt. The main results are 1. 1. The class of sets accepted by nondeterministic 2-ota's contains properly that of sets accepted by nondeterministic two-dimensional finite automata; 2. 2. The class of sets accepted by deterministic 2-ota's is incomparable with that of sets accepted by deterministic (or nondeterministic) two-dimensional finite automata. },

@inproceedings{lonati2009snake,
    abstract = {The concept of determinism, while clear and well assessed for string languages, is still matter of research as far as picture languages are concerned. We introduce here a new kind of determinism, called snake, based on the boustrophedonic scanning strategy, that is a natural scanning strategy used by many algorithms on 2D arrays and pictures. We consider a snake-deterministic variant of tiling systems, which defines the so-called Snake-DREC class of languages. Snake-DREC properly extends the more traditional approach of diagonal-based determinism, used e.g. by deterministic tiling systems, and by online tessellation automata. Our main result is showing that the concept of snake-determinism of tiles coincides with row (or column) unambiguity.},
