\chapter{Conclusion}

Lorem Ipsum

%In this thesis we have proven that the class $Diag$-DREC is a proper subset of DREC. Furthermore, we
%have proven that the family $Diag$-DREC is not closed under intersection and union, and that DREC is
%closed under rotation and intersection. It can be shown that DREC is also closed under vertical and
%horizontal concatenation, vertical and horizontal mirroring and transposing. These properties were
%ignored in this thesis because they are irrelevant for the comparison between $Diag$-DREC and DREC.
%
%It is an open problem whether DREC is closed under complement, union and projection. Remark that if
%it could be shown that DREC is not closed under union or projection, DREC would be a proper
%subset of REC.
