\chapter{Conclusion}

This thesis has made a contribute to descriptive complexity by shwing that the logic PHFL$^k$ captures the complexity class \exptime{$k$} for any $k > 1$ on finite labeled transistion systems. Because this statement also holds for $0 \leq k \leq 1$~\cite{lange2014capturing} we can extend this to PHFL$^k$ captures \exptime{$k$} for any $k \geq 0$ von finite labeled transistion systems. Furthermore, we have proven that the logic PHFL$^{k+1}_{tail}$ captures the complexity class \expspace{$k$} for any $k > 1$ on finite labeled transistion systems. Because also this statement holds for $0 \leq k \leq 1$~\cite{lange2014capturing} we can extend this to PHFL$^{k+1}_{tail}$ captures \expspace{$k$} for any $k \geq 0$ on finite labeled transistion systems.

Because quantification is not part of PHFL the main problem of these statements was the encoding of the existential quantifiers of any order in the world of PHFL seen in Section~\ref{sec:existential_quantifiers_in_phfl}. 

With these results their is given a further possibility to research on complexity classes. Maybe these logics helps by characterize the appropriate classes or divide those.

%In this thesis we have proven that the class $Diag$-DREC is a proper subset of DREC. Furthermore, we
%have proven that the family $Diag$-DREC is not closed under intersection and union, and that DREC is
%closed under rotation and intersection. It can be shown that DREC is also closed under vertical and
%horizontal concatenation, vertical and horizontal mirroring and transposing. These properties were
%ignored in this thesis because they are irrelevant for the comparison between $Diag$-DREC and DREC.
%
%It is an open problem whether DREC is closed under complement, union and projection. Remark that if
%it could be shown that DREC is not closed under union or projection, DREC would be a proper
%subset of REC.
