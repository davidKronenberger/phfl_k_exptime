%In this thesis we compare two different definitions of deterministic recognizable picture
%languages. Furthermore, we examine some closure properties of the corresponding classes of
%languages.
%
%The first definition of deterministic recognizable picture languages is from K. Reinhardt and B.
%Borchert and was introduced in~\cite{borchert2006deterministically} in 2006. This definition uses a
%domino tiling system to recognize a local picture by a deterministic process. They abbreviated their
%family of all deterministically recognizable picture languages as \emph{DREC}.
%
%In 2007 another and completely different definition was introduced by M. Anselmo, D. Giammarresi
%and M. Madonia in~\cite{anselmo2007determinism}. This definition uses a tiling system to recognize
%a picture by proceeding from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner. They also abbreviated
%their family of all deterministic recognizable picture languages by DREC. In 2009 V. Lonati and M.
%Pradella called these languages ``diagonal deterministic recognizable picture languages'' because of
%its procedure and abbreviated the class of all these languages as \emph{$Diag$-DREC}
%(see~\cite{lonati2009snake}). To avoid ambiguity, we will also adapt the abbreviation
%$Diag$-DREC in this paper.
%
%At first, we review some basic definitions of picture languages. A picture is a two-dimensional
%array of symbols and a picture language is a set of pictures. Furthermore, we describe some
%operations on pictures and languages.
%
%The following section describes the usage of tiling systems (presented
%in~\cite{giammarresi1992recognizable}) to generate pictures. This approach is based on the idea of
%the description of a picture language by a set of tiles. The set of picture languages which are
%generated by tiling systems is denoted as the class of recognizable picture languages abbreviated
%with \emph{REC}. This class can be described in many other ways e.g. with a domino system, which is
%presented in Section~\ref{domino_systems}.
%
%Every approach that generates REC recognizes a picture non-deterministically. This is the reason
%for the two definitions of DREC and $Diag$-DREC which will be presented in the next two chapters. We
%regard closure properties that are known for $Diag$-DREC and prove some missing closure properties
%of $Diag$-DREC and DREC. In~\cite{anselmo2007determinism} it is shown that $Diag$-DREC is closed
%under complement and rotation. We show that $Diag$-DREC is not closed under intersection and union.
%In the second part of these two chapters we prove that DREC is closed under rotation and
%intersection.
%
%The next part presents a special kind of two-dimensional cellular automaton which accepts
%picture languages. These automata are called two-dimensional deterministic on-line tesselation
%automata, abbreviated with \emph{2DOTA}, and were introduced in 1977 in~\cite{inoue1977properties}
%by K. Inoue and A. Nakamura. It should be noted that the non-deterministic version is another
%approach to describe REC.
%
%In the last section we compare $Diag$-DREC and DREC. In so doing we show that $Diag$-DREC is a
%strict subset of DREC.
