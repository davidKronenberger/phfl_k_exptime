\chapter{Lower Bounds}\label{ch:lowerBounds}

In this chapter we want to regard the lower bounds of PHFL$^k$ and PHFL$^k_{tail}$. The lower bounds of PHFL$^k$ and
PHFL$^k_{tail}$ can be proven by encoding the run of a Turing Machine by queries. However this kind of proof is
verbose. Instead we can detour over HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ and HO(PFP)$^{k+1}$. In more detail we encode the bisimulation
invariant fragment of HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ and HO(PFP)$^{k+1}$ into PHFL$^k$ and PHFL$^k_{tail}$ respectively. The
costliest part of these encodings is that of existential quantifiers. In the first section, we show that existential
quantifiers with bounded variable $X$ of order $k \geq 1$ can be expressed by a PHFL$^{k-1}$ formula. In the next
section we use this formula to show that the bisimulation invariant fragment of HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ can be encoded by
PHFL$^k$ and so that the lower bound of PHFL$^k$ is \exptime{$k$}. In the last section we show that the lower bound
of PHFL$^k_{tail}$ is \expspace{$k$}.
