\chapter{Lower Bounds}\label{ch:lowerBounds}

In this chapter we want to establish the lower bounds of the expressive power of PHFL$^k$ and PHFL$^k_{tail}$. The
lower bounds of PHFL$^k$ and PHFL$^k_{tail}$ can be proven by encoding the run of a Turing Machine by queries.
Another possibility for the lower bounds can be get by detour over HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ and HO(PFP)$^{k+1}$. In more detail
we encode the bisimulation-invariant fragment of HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ and HO(PFP)$^{k+1}$ into PHFL$^k$ and
PHFL$^k_{tail}$ respectively. These fragments are enough because PHFL cannot distinguish between bisimilar structures~\cite{lange2014capturing}. That means PHFL formulas can only define bisimulation-invariant
graph problems. To encode the bisimulation-invariant fragment of HO(LF\-P)$^{k+1}$ and HO(PFP)$^{k+1}$ into PHFL$^k$ and
PHFL$^{k}_{tail}$ respectively we want to translate HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ formulas into a PHFL$^k$ formula and 
HO(PFP)$^{k+1}$ into a PHFL$^k_{tail}$ formula. The costliest part of these encodings is that of existential quantifiers. In the 
first section we consider some preparations that are necessary to encode the formulas. After this we show that existential 
quantifiers with bound variable $X$ of order $k \geq 1$ can be expressed by a PHFL$^{k-1}$ formula. In the next section we 
use this formula to show that the bisimulation invariant fragment of HO(LFP)$^{k+1}$ can be encoded into PHFL$^k$ and so 
that the lower bound of the expressive power of PHFL$^k$ is \exptime{$k$}. In the last section we show that the lower bound 
of the expressive power of PHFL$^k_{tail}$ is \expspace{$k$}.
