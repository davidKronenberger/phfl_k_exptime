\section{Deterministically Recognizable Picture Languages}
In this section we present the family of deterministically recognizable picture languages introduced
by K. Reinhardt und B. Borchert in~\cite{borchert2006deterministically}. First, we describe the
definition of a determinstic process followed by the definition of the Sudoku deterministic
process.
Afterwards, we present DREC and regard some of its closure properties.
